# Diving into NLP tokenizer

A deep-dive into NLP tokenizers. Their differences, similarities and advantages.

This presentation was prepared for my talk at DSFC 2022. DSFC is a data science conference hosted by the largest 5 banks in the Netherlands.

The total presentation consists of two sets of slides. One non-interactive and one interactive. The non-interactive one you can see the easiest by clicking preview in github. The interactive slides are made in jupyter notebook with RISE, which converts a notebook into slides. You can view the notebook regardless, but if you want them as slides you will need the RISE plugin.
